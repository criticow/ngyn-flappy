## FlappyDog

Flappy bird clone made using the c++ 2D engine that I am developing while
streaming the process to YouTube, it is a simple implementation where the player
can press space to move up and control the dog to avoid the obstacles and each
time the player passes an obstacle the score increases by 1, if the dog touches
the obstacle or falls bellow the window height it is game over.
